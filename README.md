# 💻 Java DSA Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I’m diving deep into **Java** and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** step by step.  
This journey is not just about writing code — it’s about building a strong foundation in programming, improving problem-solving skills, and developing the discipline to learn consistently.

Whether it’s the basic syntax of Java, object-oriented programming concepts, or complex DSA topics like graphs and dynamic programming — I’ll be documenting and pushing everything I learn here.

> ⚠️ Although I haven’t uploaded everything yet, this is my commitment to begin now and keep going!  
> This repo will grow alongside my skills — day by day, concept by concept, code by code. ✨

## 📅 My Roadmap

I’ll be learning and uploading code regularly as I go through topics.  
The idea is to keep things **clean, structured, and easy to revisit** when needed.

My focus will be on:

- Understanding concepts deeply
- Practicing with multiple problems
- Writing clean, readable code
- Documenting solutions wherever required

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This?

This repo isn’t just for others — it’s for **me**.  
To **track my growth**, stay **accountable**, and build a **portfolio of my learning**.  
By making my journey public, I hope to stay consistent and **inspire others** who are just starting out.
